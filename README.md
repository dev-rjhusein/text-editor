# text-editor
Hello, I have been following the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UghqfpA2zy4 .

This is a text editor created using javax swing library as well as io, awt.event 

The class "Editor" is slightly different as the video shows but it should not change the function of the program.
I hope to modify this program to be similar to google docs except also and IDE. For now the editor is 
all I have built.
